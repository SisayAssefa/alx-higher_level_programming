In this project, I learned handling errors and exceptions in Python with `try`
and `except`.

## General

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
* What are exceptions and how to use them
* When do we need to use exceptions
* How to correctly handle an exception
* What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
* How to raise a builtin exception
* When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception
